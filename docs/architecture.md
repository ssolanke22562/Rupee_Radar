Architecture
RupeeRadar — System Architecture
This document describes the technical architecture for RupeeRadar, an AI-powered personal finance assistant. It is
derived from context.md and defines how raw bank statement data flows through the system to produce categorized
transactions, recurring-payment detection, financial metrics, and human-readable insights.
1. Architectural Goals
Goal Rationale
End-to-end workflow Upload → insights must work as a single user journey
Messy-data tolerance Indian bank/UPI descriptions vary widely; normalization is first-class
Privacy by design Financial data is sensitive; minimize exposure and retention
Prototype-first Ship a working vertical slice before supporting every bank format
Inspectable output Users should see cleaned data, not just a black-box summary
Extensible parsing New bank formats plug in without rewriting the core pipeline
2. High-Level System View
RupeeRadar is organized as a pipeline-oriented, modular monolith for the prototype phase. A single application
hosts ingestion, processing, analytics, and presentation. This keeps deployment simple while preserving clear module
boundaries for future extraction into services.
Recommended Stack (Prototype)
Layer Recommendation Alternatives
Frontend React + TypeScript + Tailwind Next.js, Vue
Backend Python FastAPI Node.js Express, Django
Database SQLite (local) → PostgreSQL (deployed) —
File parsing pandas + bank-specific parsers openpyxl, pdfplumber
AI categorization LLM API with structured output Rule engine + LLM fallback
Charts Recharts or Chart.js D3
Report export HTML → PDF (weasyprint / browser print) —
Deployment Docker + single VM / Railway / Render Local-only demo
Stack choices are flexible per context.md; the architecture below is stack-agnostic.

├── status: pending | parsing | processing | ready | failed
├── uploaded_at, expires_at (TTL for privacy)

3.2 Canonical Transaction Schema
All parsers must emit this normalized shape before downstream processing:
{
"date": "2025-06-01",
"description_raw": "UPI-SWIGGY-BANGALORE-123456",
"amount": -450.00,
"type": "debit",
"balance": 12500.00
}
Normalization rules:
● Dates → ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
● Amounts → decimal, INR, debits negative (or separate type + absolute amount — pick one convention and
enforce consistently)
● Descriptions → trimmed; preserve description_raw for audit
● Duplicates → detect via (date, amount, description_raw) hash within a session
3.3 Category Taxonomy
Fixed enum aligned with requirements:
Food · Travel · Shopping · Bills · EMI · Subscriptions · Salary · Rent · Investments · Other
Salary and Investments are typically credits; the rest are primarily debits. Other is the fallback when confidence is below
threshold.
4. Processing Pipeline
The pipeline runs synchronously for small statements (< ~2,000 rows) and can move to a background job queue for
larger files.

└──────────┘ └──────────┘ └────────────────────────┘
4.1 Stage 1 — Ingestion & Parsing
Responsibility: Accept files, detect format, extract raw rows.
Input format Parser strategy
CSV Column mapping via header detection + heuristics
Excel (.xlsx) Same as CSV; handle merged cells
PDF Table extraction (pdfplumber); bank-specific templates for prototype
Parser interface (plugin pattern):
class StatementParser(Protocol):
def can_parse(self, file: UploadFile) -> bool: ...
def parse(self, file: UploadFile) -> list[RawTransaction]: ...
Prototype scope: Support 1–2 common Indian bank CSV exports (e.g. HDFC, ICICI, SBI). Generic CSV mapper with
user column mapping as fallback.
Validation:
● Reject empty files, password-protected PDFs (with clear error)
● Enforce max file size (e.g. 10 MB)
● Log parse warnings (skipped rows, ambiguous dates) for UI display
4.2 Stage 2 — Cleaning & Normalization
Responsibility: Turn messy descriptions into structured, comparable text.
Step Example
Strip noise UPI/DR/123456/SWIGGY → SWIGGY
Merchant extraction Regex + known-merchant dictionary (Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon, etc.)
Mode detection UPI, NEFT, IMPS, card, cash
Amount sign correction Ensure debits/credits align with statement conventions
Date repair Handle DD-MM-YYYY vs DD/MM/YY
Output: description_clean, optional merchant, payment_mode.
Cleaning is largely deterministic (rules + dictionary). This improves categorization accuracy and keeps LLM calls
smaller.
4.3 Stage 3 — Categorization
Responsibility: Assign each transaction to the taxonomy.
Hybrid approach (recommended):
1. Rule engine (fast, high precision for known patterns)
↓ unmatched
2. Merchant dictionary lookup
↓ still unmatched
3. LLM batch categorization (structured JSON output)
↓ low confidence
4. Default → Other
Rule examples:
Pattern Category
SALARY, NEFT CREDIT SALARY Salary
NETFLIX, SPOTIFY, YOUTUBE Subscriptions
SWIGGY, ZOMATO, DOMINOS Food
UBER, OLA, IRCTC, MAKEMYTRIP Travel
SIP, ZERODHA, GROWW Investments
HOME LOAN, EMI EMI
LLM prompt design:
● Batch transactions (e.g. 20–50 per call) with description_clean, amount, type
● Request JSON: { "id": "...", "category": "...", "confidence": 0.85 }
● Include few-shot examples for Indian UPI-style strings
● Never send account numbers or full raw statements if avoidable
Confidence threshold: e.g. < 0.6 → Other, flag for user review in UI.
4.4 Stage 4 — Recurring Payment Detection
Responsibility: Identify subscriptions, EMIs, rent, SIPs, insurance.
Heuristic algorithm:
1. Group debits by similar description_clean (fuzzy match, Levenshtein or token overlap)
2. Within each group, check:
○ ≥ 2 occurrences
○ Amount within tolerance (e.g. ±5% or ±₹50)
○ Intervals consistent with monthly (~28–32 days) or other cadence
3. Label group from merchant name or dominant keyword
4. Override category if pattern matches known recurring types (EMI, SIP)
Output: RecurringGroup records + is_recurring flags on transactions.
4.5 Stage 5 — Metrics & Aggregations
Responsibility: Compute summary numbers for dashboard and insights.
Metric Definition
Total income Sum of credits in selected period
Total spend Sum of debits (absolute value)
Savings Income − spend
Savings rate Savings / income × 100
Top categories Debit totals grouped by category, sorted desc
Biggest transaction Single largest debit (and optionally credit)
Monthly spend Debits grouped by calendar month
Recurring total Sum of typical amounts from recurring groups
Time scope: Default to full statement range; UI filter for "this month" based on latest transaction date or user selection.
4.6 Stage 6 — Insight Generation
Responsibility: Produce ≥ 3 personalized, human-readable insights using real amounts.
Two-tier approach:
1. Template insights (deterministic, always available):
○ "You spent ₹X on Food this month — your largest category."
○ "Your biggest transaction was ₹Y to {merchant} on {date}."
○ "We detected N recurring payments totalling ₹Z/month."
2. LLM-enhanced insights (optional):
○ Feed metrics + top categories + recurring summary (not raw PII)
○ Generate 2–3 narrative observations (spending trends, category shifts)
Insights must cite actual transaction amounts per requirements.
4.7 Stage 7 — Presentation & Export
Dashboard views:
View Content
Summary cards Income, spend, savings, savings rate
Category breakdown Pie/bar chart by category
Monthly trend Line/bar chart of spend over time
Transaction table Sortable, filterable, with category badges
Recurring panel List of detected subscriptions/EMIs with amounts
Insights panel ≥ 3 insight cards
Report export:
● HTML report rendered server-side or client-side
● PDF via print stylesheet or weasyprint
● Shareable summary (screenshot-friendly single page)
5. API Design
RESTful API under /api/v1. All endpoints scoped to an UploadSession.
Method Endpoint Description
POST /upload Upload statement file; returns
session_id
GET /sessions/{id} Session status and metadata
GET /sessions/{id}/transactions Paginated cleaned transactions
PATCH /sessions/{id}/transactions/{txn_id} User override category (optional)
GET /sessions/{id}/recurring Detected recurring groups
GET /sessions/{id}/analytics Metrics and aggregations
GET /sessions/{id}/insights Generated insights
GET /sessions/{id}/report Downloadable report
(HTML/PDF)
DELETE /sessions/{id} Purge session data
Upload flow:
POST /upload (multipart file)
→ 202 { session_id, status: "processing" }
→ client polls GET /sessions/{id} until status = "ready"
→ client fetches transactions, analytics, insights in parallel
For prototype simplicity, processing can be synchronous with a loading spinner for small files.
6. Frontend Architecture
6.1 Page Structure
/ → Landing + upload
/analysis/:sessionId → Main dashboard (tabs or sections)
├── Summary
├── Transactions
├── Recurring
├── Insights
└── Export
6.2 State Management
● Server state: React Query / SWR for API data (transactions, analytics)
● UI state: Local component state (filters, sort, active tab)
● No persistent client storage of financial data (privacy)
6.3 Key Components
Component Responsibility
FileUpload Drag-drop, format hints, progress
ProcessingStatus Pipeline stage indicator
SummaryCards Income, spend, savings
CategoryChart Visual breakdown
TransactionTable Search, filter by category, edit category
RecurringList Recurring payment cards
InsightCards Narrative insights
ReportExport Download / print trigger
6.4 UX Principles
● Show cleaned data alongside raw description (transparency)
● Allow category override (improves trust and future rule learning)
● Clear errors for unsupported formats with sample CSV template
● Mobile-responsive but desktop-first for tables
7. Data Storage
7.1 Prototype Schema (relational)
upload_sessions
transactions
recurring_groups
analysis_results
SQLite suffices for local demo. PostgreSQL for deployment.
7.2 Retention Policy
Policy Implementation
Session TTL Auto-delete sessions after 24–72 hours (configurable)
No cross-user data Sessions are anonymous or single-user
Upload files Delete raw file after successful parse
LLM logs Do not log full transaction descriptions externally
7.3 Indexing
● transactions(session_id, date)
● transactions(session_id, category)
● recurring_groups(session_id)
8. Security & Privacy Architecture
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Privacy boundaries │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Browser ──HTTPS──▶ API (auth optional for prototype) │
│ API ──local DB──▶ No third-party storage of statements │
│ API ──minimal fields──▶ LLM (only if user consents) │
│ Raw files deleted post-parse │
│ Session purge via TTL or explicit DELETE │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Control Prototype Production hardening
Transport HTTPS TLS 1.2+
Authentication Optional / none OAuth or magic link
File validation Type + size checks Virus scan, content sniffing
Secrets .env, not committed Secret manager
LLM data Batch descriptions only DPA, opt-out, local model option
CORS Restrict to frontend origin Same
9. Error Handling & Observability
9.1 Failure Modes
Stage User-facing message Recovery
Unsupported format "We couldn't read this file. Try CSV export from your
bank."
Offer sample template
Parse partial failure "Imported 450 of 462 rows" Show warnings list
Empty statement "No transactions found" Re-upload
LLM unavailable Fallback to rules-only categorization Degrade gracefully
Processing timeout "Still processing…" or retry Background job + poll
9.2 Logging
● Structured logs: session_id, stage, duration_ms, row_count
● Never log full account numbers, balances, or raw file contents
● Metrics: parse success rate, categorization confidence distribution, p95 latency
10. Deployment Architecture
10.1 Local Development
docker compose up
├── api (FastAPI, port 8000)
├── web (Vite dev server, port 5173)
└── db (SQLite volume or Postgres)
10.2 Prototype Deployment
Internet

11. Testing Strategy
Layer Focus
Unit Parsers, cleaners, categorization rules, recurring detector, metrics
Integration Full pipeline on fixture CSVs (messy real-world samples)
Golden files Expected output for 3–5 anonymized statements
E2E Upload → dashboard shows categories + insights
Manual UX walkthrough, report export, mobile layout
Fixture requirements: Include messy UPI strings, mixed date formats, salary credits, EMI debits, and duplicate-like
entries.
12. Implementation Phases

13. Mapping to Requirements
context.md requirement Architecture component
Accept bank statement data Ingestion module, POST /upload
Extract/clean transactions Parser plugins + Cleaning stage
Categorize expenses Rule engine + LLM hybrid
Detect recurring payments Recurring detection stage
Calculate metrics Analytics module
Human-readable insights Insight generator (templates + LLM)
Dashboard / report Frontend views + /report export
Privacy-conscious handling TTL, no raw file retention, minimal LLM payload
Prototype over perfect bank support Plugin parsers, 1–2 formats first
14. Open Decisions
Decision Options Recommendation
Debit sign convention Negative amounts vs. type +
positive
Negative for debits (simpler summing)
Auth for prototype None vs. simple password None; add note in demo
LLM provider OpenAI, Anthropic, local Whichever is available; abstract behind
interface
PDF parsing Generic vs. bank-specific CSV first; PDF as stretch
Background jobs Sync vs. Celery/RQ Sync until >5s processing observed
